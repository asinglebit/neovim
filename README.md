This Neovim configuration uses a **custom-designed color theme** optimized for **reducing visual noise** and improving focus during coding.  

### Key Features:

- **Muted Backgrounds:** Soft, low-contrast background colors reduce eye strain over long sessions.
- **Focused Syntax Highlighting:** Important syntax elements like keywords, functions, and variables are highlighted clearly, while less relevant elements are subtly muted.
- **Reduced Visual Clutter:** Minimal use of bright or saturated colors for secondary UI elements (statusline, line numbers, floating windows).
- **Consistent Icon Colors:** File icons, LSP symbols, and UI highlights follow a coherent color palette to aid quick recognition.
- ** guita╭ compatible** Designed to be visually compatible with my other project, the **guita╭** git tui client: https://github.com/asinglebit/guitar

## 9. Prerequisites

Before setting up the environment or running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

1. **ripgrep** (used by Telescope for text searching):

   `ripgrep` is an ultra-fast text search tool that Telescope uses for its `live_grep` functionality. You can install it using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ripgrep
   ```

1. **compilers** (used by Telescope for text searching):

   The build-essential package contains a list of packages that are required for compiling and building software on Ubuntu or Debian-based systems.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install build-essential
   ```

- Make sure to install ts_ls via Mason, otherwise, remove the typescript lang support
- Make sure to install codelldb via Mason, otherwise, remove the rust support
